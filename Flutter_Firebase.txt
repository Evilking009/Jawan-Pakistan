Previously there was Realtime data implementation i.e MVC framework

MVC -> Model View Controller
    -> Model (i.e Database) , View (i.e Display/Screen) , Controller (i.e business logic that connects Model-View / also called Server)
    
> Socket.io plays vital role in realtime data implementation

// Firebase
- A Realtime database
- Uses MVC Framework
- Any changes done in Model, also changes the View by Controller. This concept ccalled 3-way data binding
- History: It is made by 3 students in Australia as FYP with following MVC framework. Google bought in billions and is property of google now.

// Why Learn Firebase, instead of Nodejs?
