DevOps Methodology

> in Old times Developers and testers work seperatey, and Operations team/ IT Team that do execution, server deployment, tracking, ensuring application is working properly.

> Developers + Operations(IT) combo.

> Now Developer also doing Operations work

> Developer creates Project, Operation team helps in execution, server based deployment, tracking.

> For ex: Developer's App is ready, but Ops team is busy not to deploy. so DevOps do both work.

> Amazon major work in cloud, DevOps

> Ops challenges: concerned about infrastructure, has to reinvent everytime dev make changes in codes.



>> Linux is important to learn DevOps, but can also work on windows.
